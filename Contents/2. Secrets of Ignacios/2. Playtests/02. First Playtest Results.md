| I would for now just focus on teleporting instead of the constant movement. For aiming make use a little bit more of an auto aim function or that you get an indicator where you're kind of aiming. And some feedback would be nice when I messed up activating a spell. |

| the aiming felt a bit off, doesn't feel like it follows the direction of my hand palm     |
