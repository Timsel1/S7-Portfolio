| 1           | I did not know the thumb method existed                                                                   |
| 2           | It was convenient to use.                                                                                 |
| 3           | More control                                                                                              |
| 4           | Felt far more consistent than the camera option                                                           |
| 5           | -                                                                                                         |
| 6           | what? the finger method was very inconvenient as I had to hold my hand and finger down below the waist    |
| 7           | I couldn't use the thumb move                                                                             |

| 2           | just recognize it more often                                    |
| 3           | consistency                                                     |
| 4           | Don't make me reach that far, I'm not that flexible.            |
| 5           | -                                                               |
| 6           | pointing towards where you want to go instead of having to point up |

| Participant | Opinion                                                                              |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1           | -                                                                                    |
| 2           | Give a bit more time to aim the spell                                                |
| 3           | make them appear for longer when aiming                                              |
| 4           | Colour, more opaque, more themed to the spell.                                       |
| 5           | -                                                                                    |
| 6           | I would change the way to cast them by pointing instead of using an open hand        |
| 7           | The indicator is fine as it is                                                       |
