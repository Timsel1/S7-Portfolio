## Introduction
This test focused on evaluating two new movement systems (camera-directed and joystick-like), the feel of added gravity, and the usability of a new spell aim indicator in a VR game. The goal was to gather feedback on preferred movement methods, assess the naturalness of gravity, and determine if the new spell aim indicator improved spellcasting accuracy.


## Test Environment
- **Device**: Meta Quest (Pro) headset with hand tracking enabled
- **Location**: Demo lab space in TQ open area, providing sufficient space for safe and controlled VR movement
- **Participant Tools**: Survey forms, real-time observations, and optional video recordings to capture details on gravity, movement controls, and aim accuracy


## Test Plan Coverage
The playtest covered all scenarios specified in the test plan:
1. **Movement System Comparison**: Participants tested both camera-directed and joystick-like movement to identify a preferred method.
2. **Gravity Evaluation**: Gravity adjustments were tested in various scenarios, including jumping, falling, and rapid directional changes.
3. **Spell Aim Indicator**: Participants evaluated the clarity and responsiveness of the new spell aim indicator, with feedback collected on its impact on aiming accuracy.


## Test Execution
The test was executed as follows:
1. **Warm-Up**: Participants were allowed a short period to familiarize themselves with VR movement, gravity effects, and spell aim indicator functionality.
2. **Main Test**:
   - Movement and gravity were tested by guiding participants to navigate with both camera-directed and joystick-like movement methods.
   - Participants then tested the gravity in various settings to ensure it felt neither too heavy nor too floaty.
   - Spell aim indicators were tested by having participants aim and cast spells, with feedback gathered on clarity and ease of aiming.
3. **Post-Test Survey**: Participants answered questions to provide qualitative and quantitative feedback on each area tested.


## Test Results

### Movement System
- **Preferred Method**: Most participants preferred the **camera-directed movement**.
  - **Feedback**: Some mentioned better consistency with camera direction. Feedback indicated discomfort with the thumb method for certain participants due to hand positioning requirements.
- **Suggested Improvements**: Suggestions allowing movement without the need for precise gestures were given.

| Movement Option Preferred  | Opinion           |
|-|-|
| Camera Direction           | 5 participants    |
| Thumb                      | 2 participants    |
| No Answer                  | 1 participant     |

### Gravity Evaluation
- **General Feedback**: Most participants felt the added gravity feature felt natural. Some participants did not notice the gravity at all, which is a good sign since you don't really notice it in everyday life (this feature is purely aimed at the player character and not the environment around the player).

| Gravity Feedback     | Opinion       |
|-|-|
| Felt natural         | 5 participants |
| Didn't notice        | 3 participants |

### Spell Aim Indicator
- **Effectiveness**: All participants agreed that the indicator improved aiming for spellcasting.
  - **Suggested Improvements**: Requests were made for a longer duration of indicator visibility, one participant suggested an indicator color change to better suit spell themes and 1 person told us to make the indicator visibility shorter (this was said on voice recording). 

| Indicator Effectiveness | Opinion       |
|-|-|
| Yes                     | 7 participants|
| No                      | 0 participants|

| Suggested Improvements                            | Opinion                                     |
|:-                                                 |:-                                           |
| Increase visibility duration                      | 2 participants                              |
| Decrease visibility duration                      | 1 participant                               |
| Make indicator color more spell-themed            | 1 participant                               |
| No changes needed                                 | 4 participants                              |

### Difficulty in Aiming Spells
- **Average Difficulty Rating**: Responses indicated that participants found aiming to be somewhat challenging, with most ratings closer to the harder end of the scale (1-2).
A few participants found it relatively easy (rating of 4), while no participants rated it as very easy. This was partly expected since most participants had never played before,
and this is part of the learning curve of the game.

| Aiming Difficulty Rating | Frequency |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| 1 (Very Hard)            | 1         |
| 2                        | 3         |
| 3                        | 0         |
| 4                        | 2         |
| 5 (Very Easy)            | 0         |


## Conclusion
The second playtest provided valuable insights into the movement options, gravity effects, and spell aim indicator:
1. **Movement Preference**: The camera-directed movement was generally preferred. However, a few participants encountered issues with gesture recognition and hand positioning,
this can either come back to experience with the system or the gesture needing to be more lenient.
3. **Gravity Feedback**: Gravity adjustments were well-received, with participants noting that it felt natural or wasn't noticed, which is a good sign and means we can move forward with this setting.
4. **Spell Aim Indicator**: Participants found the indicator helpful for aiming, though some adjustments to duration and theme might improve its effectiveness further. The best course of action would
be to add asetting to adjust the visibility time for the indicator, this way people who would like a shoter charge time can play with less restictions and people in need for extra help can learn at their own pace.
