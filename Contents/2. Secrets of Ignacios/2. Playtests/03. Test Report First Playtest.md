## Introduction
The purpose of this playtest was to assess the usability and effectiveness of hand tracking, spell casting, and movement in Secrets of Ignacios' current state. 
The focus was put on the "alternative" movement mode, gesture recognition accuracy, and the overall player experience during spell casting. 
The test aimed to gather feedback on how quickly players get used to the gesture-based casting system and whether the quick casting feature improved usability.

## Test Environment
- **Device**: Meta Quest (pro) headset with hand tracking enabled.
- **Game Environment**: Secrets of Ignacios grayboxing level with static gesture recognition for spell casting and two movement options (teleport and alternative walking).
- **Participants**: 4 individuals (1 game design teacher, 3 ict/game design students) with a mix of VR and gaming experience.

## Test Plan Coverage
The playtest covered key areas essential for understanding user interactions with the game mechanics:
- **Movement Options**: Evaluation of the teleport mode vs. the alternative movement mode.
- **Gesture Recognition**: How well the game recognised and processed gestures used for spell casting.
- **Hand Tracking Performance**: The responsiveness and accuracy of the hand tracking system.
- **Spell Casting Experience**: Player preferences between full spell sequence casting and quick casting.
- **User Feedback**: Direct user input regarding motion sickness, aiming issues, and general comfort.

## Test Execution
Participants followed a series of tasks to assess:
1. **Movement**: They tested both teleport and alternative movement modes.
2. **Spell Casting**: Participants were asked to perform a series of gestures to prime and cast spells.
3. **Quick Casting**: They tested the quick casting feature as an alternative to the full gesture sequence.
4. **Survey & Observation**: After the play session, participants provided feedback on motion sickness, gesture ease, and hand tracking issues.

## Test Results

### Movement Preferences
All participants showed a clear preference for the teleport movement option over the alternative mode. This suggests that the alternative walking system, while an interesting concept, currently lacks 
the smoothness or comfort needed to compete with teleportation, especially in terms of user experience and motion sickness. This was due to the temporary handsign not being comfotable, and the anchor point being tied to the camera, meaning that if the player moved their
head, they'd walk in a different direction.

### Motion Sickness
Motion sickness was a significant issue for half of the participants when using the alternative movement mode. This was to be expected, since no prevention systems have been implemented yet. The anchor point being
tied to the camera tied was also motion sickness inducint to some players.

### Spell Casting Sequence
The full sequence for casting spells was generally rated as moderately easy to perform, though there is room for improvement. Players indicated that the
system could benefit from clearer guidance and more accurate feedback when a gesture was incorrectly recognized.

### Quick Casting Feature
The quick casting feature was well received, with most participants preferring it over having to redo the full sequence casting over and over again. It was however mentioned that it could take away from the fantasy
aspect of the game.

### Hand Tracking Reliability
The hand tracking system performed well overall, but occasional issues with gesture recognition and unintended actions (such as teleport triggering offscreen) were noted. 
Addressing these inconsistencies will help improve reliability and reduce player frustration.

### Aiming Spells
Aiming spells after casting was a significant pain point for participants. Players found the aiming mechanics imprecise, making it difficult to control where spells were directed. 
Implementing features like an aiming indicator or slight auto-aim functionality could drastically improve the user experience.

### User Suggestions
Several participants suggested focusing on teleportation as the primary movement method, at least in the short term, due to its comfort and reliability. 
Others recommended adding visual indicators for aiming spells, as well as more refined feedback mechanisms to alert players when a spell sequence is performed in the wrong order.

## Conclusion
The playtest provided insights into several areas requiring improvement. The **alternative movement mode** needs substantial revisions to make it more intuitive and comfortable, 
especially to address motion sickness. **Gesture recognition** and **feedback mechanisms** also need enhancements to ensure a smoother and more responsive experience. The **quick casting feature** 
was a success, while the **aiming mechanic** needs further improvements.

These findings will inform the next steps in improving the game, ensuring that core mechanics such as movement, spell casting, and hand tracking meet user expectations and enhance gameplay immersion.
