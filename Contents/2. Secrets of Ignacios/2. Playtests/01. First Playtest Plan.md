## Objectives of the Play Test
Evaluate the usability and effectiveness of hand tracking, spell casting, and movement in the VR game. Focus on the "alternative" movement mode, gesture recognition accuracy, 
and user experience during spell casting, while also assessing how quickly and easily players are able to get used to this casting system.

## Test Target Group
Participants of varying ages (19-60 for this test), with a mix of VR experience levels, from beginners to advanced users. 
These participants will also include game design students to give extra feedback on design choices.

## Test Scenarios
- **Movement Evaluation**: Test both teleport and alternative movement options, focusing primarily on the alternative movement activated by gestures. 
- **Spell Casting Evaluation**: Participants perform a series of gestures to prime and cast spells.
- **Quick Casting**: Participants try out quick casting to compare it to the whole sequence.
- **Hand Tracking Evaluation**: Assess the reliability and accuracy of the static gesture recognition system.

## Test Material
- **Device**: Meta Quest (Pro) headset with hand tracking enabled.
- **Environment**: TQ open space in demo lab.
- **Participant Feedback Tools**: Survey/questionnaire forms, observation notes.

## Test Procedure
1. **Introduction**: Explain the purpose of the test and give participants a brief overview of the game.
2. **Warm-Up**: Allow participants to get familiar with hand tracking and gestures.
3. **Main Test**:
   - **Movement**: Guide participants to try both teleport and alternative movement, emphasizing the alternative method.
   - **Spell Casting**: Have participants perform a series of gesture sequences to prime and cast spells.
4. **Post-Test Survey**: Ask participants about their experiences, focusing on ease of use, gesture recognition clarity, and movement preference.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Movement**: Effectiveness and comfort of using the alternative movement mode compared to teleportation. Frequency of motion sickness, if at all.
- **Spell Casting**: Accuracy of gesture recognition, clarity of feedback for correct/incorrect spell sequences, ease of aiming and participant preference between full recast and quick cast.
- **Hand Tracking**: Intuitiveness of gestures, responsiveness, and reliability of recognition.

## Reporting
- **Participant Preferences**: Movement and spell casting preferences.
- **Issues Identified**: Challenges in gesture recognition, movement discomfort, and clarity of feedback.
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions for improving hand tracking, spell casting, and movement mechanics.
