## Objectives of the Play Test
Assess the player experience with two new movement methods (camera-directed forward movement and joystick-like movement), the natural feel of added gravity, and the usability of the new spell aim indicator. Focus on balancing gravity to ensure it feels neither too strong nor too floaty, supporting an immersive experience.

## Test Target Group
Participants aged 19-60 with varying VR experience levels. Include game design students to gather feedback on design elements like movement realism and gravity.

## Test Scenarios

1. **Movement System Comparison**:
   - **Camera-Directed Forward Movement**: Evaluate ease of use, intuitiveness, and control.
   - **Joystick-Like Movement**: Assess ease of navigation and precision in a joystick-style control scheme.
   - **Preference Evaluation**: Gather feedback on comfort, preference, and ease of use for each movement type.

2. **Addition of Gravity**:
   - Test the gravity in various scenarios to see if it feels realistic and/or natural.
   - Gather feedback on whether gravity feels too strong, too weak, or just right, aiming for balance to avoid excessive heaviness or floatiness.

3. **Spell Aim Indicator**:
   - Test the new spell aim indicator’s clarity and responsiveness.
   - Evaluate if it helps participants improve spellcasting accuracy and feels aligned with their aiming intentions.

## Test Material

- **Device**: Meta Quest (3/Pro) headset with hand tracking enabled.
- **Environment**: Demo lab space, a spacious room where we can be as loud as we like and not bother others.
- **Feedback Tools**: Surveys, real-time observation notes, and optional voice recordings.

## Test Procedure

1. **Introduction**: Explain the test’s objectives, emphasizing the importance of player feedback on movement methods, gravity adjustments, and the new aim indicator.
2. **Warm-Up Session**: Let participants get comfortable with the movement controls, gravity effects, and the spell aim indicator.
3. **Main Test**:
   - **Movement and Gravity Test**: Guide participants through both movement methods and assess comfort, ease of control, and the natural feel of gravity and abrupt direction changes.
   - **Spell Casting and Aim Test**: Have participants use the spell aim indicator, focusing on alignment with their intended aim and any improvements in spellcasting accuracy.
4. **Post-Test Survey**: Collect feedback on gravity realism, movement preferences, and the aim indicator’s impact on spellcasting accuracy.

## Expected Results

- **Movement**: Players will likely prefer camera movement over the joystick method, this will probably be because not everyone can move their thumb as easily as me. I learned this when testing this movement option with 
my group members and expect this will be the same for other players.
- **Gravity**: Gravity will likely go unnoticed, since there aren't any real drops or jumps in our game, there are stairs and objects on the ground however where gravity will play a role. The goal is for gravity
to go unnoticed or be rated as realistic.
- **Spell Aim Indicator**: I expect people to be able to hit their target with the spells that use this system more reliably than during the last playtest, this is also the goal for this feature. 

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Movement and Gravity**: Evaluate comfort, ease of movement control, and realism of gravity. Look for participant feedback on whether gravity feels appropriate or requires adjustments.
- **Spell Aim Indicator**: Assess indicator clarity, responsiveness, and the user’s sense of improved accuracy in spellcasting.

## Reporting

- **Participant Preferences**: Identify preferred movement method, gravity feedback, and any suggestions for adjustments.
- **Challenges and Observations**: Note any difficulties with movement control, gravity issues, or aim alignment.
- **Recommendations**: Provide actionable feedback on refining movement, gravity balance, or spell aim alignment based on player experiences.
