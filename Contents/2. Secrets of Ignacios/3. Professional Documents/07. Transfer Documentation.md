# Transfer Documentation
It was suggested to add transfer documentation to our project, so it can be used as an example for future students, this would make it easier for teacher to show how everything works and was designed. 
This could also open up the possibility of a continuation on the project. Since I'm very familiar with markdown and could use this to go for an outstanding I took this task upon myself.

## How did I write this?
I'm familiar with technical transfer documentation, but this was not all I needed to write about and add to our repository. To find out about what was required for complete transfer documentation, I asked a 
teacher for info about this topic. I was provided with a transfer documentation workshop presentation, which I was able to use to make my transfer documentation more complete. A lot of documents that were requires
were easily found in our documentsand links channel. I also converted all of the documents to markdown to improve the reading experience inside of a repository. For the technical documentation a little extra work was required. I updated my current uml for the spell casting system and created uml diagrams for other important 
systems, since they weren't made beforehand.

## What is the result?
So far I have collected all design documents, reasearch, test reports and results and written 3 technical documents. All 4 documents have a diagram to go with them.

## What is the quality of the result?
I have not yet received feedback on my documentation, I did send it to a teacher, but since all of this was mentioned and done pretty last moment it has not been reviewed yet.
The documentation can be found in [the groups repository here](https://github.com/Rogue-Ape-Studios-XR/Secrets-of-Ignacios/tree/develop) (this is a link to the development branch, if the README is empty and a documentation folder does not exist, switch to the documentaion/trnasfer-documentation branch).

## What is the next step now that I have this result?
I plan to finish as much as possible before innovation insights, so people can easily understand the project.
