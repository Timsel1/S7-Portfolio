# Advice on Hand Tracking Games
When creating a game that makes use of hand tracking there are a lot of things to consider, since the technology isn't very advanced without the use hardware that is not just the VR headset cameras. This document
will provide some advice on those aspects.

## Accuracy and Sensitivity
  Hand tracking heavily relies on the camera’s ability to recognise and track hands in real time. The accuracy of tracking can be affected by factors such as lighting conditions, background clutter, and hand positioning.
   - Pay close attention to the sensitivity of hand detection algorithms. Fine-tune your game’s tracking to ensure it captures subtle hand movements without false positives or missed gestures.

## Calibration and Environmental Setup
   - Since hand tracking is camera-based, it’s crucial to set up the environment correctly. Make sure that players have enough space to move freely, and ensure there’s adequate lighting to improve visibility.
   - Providing simple calibration tools within the game can help users optimize their setup for better tracking performance. This could include hand positioning exercises to fine-tune the system’s sensitivity.

## Hand Occlusion Handling
   - In VR, hand occlusion—where one hand blocks the view of the other—is a common challenge. Properly managing this can prevent tracking errors. 
   - Design game mechanics that account for occlusions, using visual cues or having the game reorient hands accordingly when parts are blocked.

## Performance Optimization
   - Hand tracking can be demanding on system resources, particularly if you’re using highly detailed models or real-time interaction with hand movements.
   - Optimize your game’s hand-tracking algorithm by using efficient tracking models and focusing on the most important features to reduce processing load.

## Feedback and User Experience
   - Clear visual feedback is essential in hand tracking games. Providing users with immediate feedback on their hand movements can enhance the immersion and help them understand how their gestures are being interpreted.
   - Consider incorporating haptic feedback (when possible) to create more intuitive interactions and enhance user immersion.

## Multi-Hand Interaction
   - Many hand-tracking games involve interactions that require using both hands. Designing multi-hand mechanics can add depth to gameplay, but it can also introduce complexity in tracking and controlling multiple hands simultaneously.
   - Ensure your system can handle both hands interacting independently without confusion or lag.

## Customization and Accessibility
   - Not all players have the same level of comfort or skill when using hand tracking. Provide customizable options for hand sensitivity, control schemes, and feedback to accommodate different playstyles and preferences.
   - Accessibility features, such as voice commands or alternative input methods, can also help broaden your game’s reach.

## Testing and Iteration
   - Extensive testing is key to improving hand-tracking performance. Conduct tests with users of different hand sizes, backgrounds, and playstyles to catch edge cases and refine your game.
   - Iterate based on feedback, focusing on improving both tracking accuracy and user experience.

## Future-Proofing
   - Hand tracking technology is evolving rapidly, so consider future-proofing your game design. Keep an eye on developments in hardware improvements, camera technology, and new tracking algorithms.
   - Ensure your game is adaptable to future advancements by using flexible systems that can easily integrate new tracking solutions as they become available.
