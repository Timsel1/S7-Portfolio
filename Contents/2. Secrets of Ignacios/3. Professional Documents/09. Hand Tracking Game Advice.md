# Advice on Hand Tracking Games
When creating a game that makes use of hand tracking there are a lot of things to consider, since the technology isn't very advanced without the use hardware that is not just the VR headset cameras. This document
will provide some advice on those aspects.

## Control Scheme
Since there isn’t a standardized control scheme for hand tracking games, you’ll need to design one from scratch. This could be done in a few different ways, depending on the gameplay experience you want to create.

One approach is to provide an in game controller that players can use to interact with the game. This could involve virtual buttons or sliders, giving players familiar cues while still utilizing their hands. This method works well for games that aim to balance hand tracking with traditional input, providing a more seamless experience for players who might prefer not to rely solely on their hands.

Alternatively, you could fully integrate hand tracking, allowing players to control the game character directly with their hands. This approach creates a more immersive experience, where players physically move their hands to interact with objects, perform actions, or manipulate the environment. This approach does come with the risk of not everyone being able to play your game, or that some things will feel uncomfortable to some players.

Ultimately, the control scheme you choose should align with the type of game you’re creating, ensuring that players feel comfortable and engaged while interacting with the world using their hands.

## Accuracy and Sensitivity
Hand tracking in VR relies on the camera’s ability to accurately recognise and follow hands in real time. However, this can easily be affected by lighting, background clutter, or hand positioning, causing tracking to falter. To ensure precision, make sure to fine tune the sensitivity of the used hand detection algorithms, capturing subtle gestures without false positives or missed movements. By carefully adjusting these settings interactionswill be more responsive so every gesture is accurately translated into gameplay. With the XR hands package this can be done with the HandShape asset.

## Hand Occlusion Handling
In VR, hand occlusion, where one hand blocks the view of the other, can be a common challenge that leads to tracking errors. During development of a hand tracking game this should be taken into account, try to avoid actions that block the view of certain fingers of hands, ensuring that movements remain fluid and accurate. Escpecially when using gesture recognition it is important to have a good view of the whole hand to avoid gestures not being recognised.

## Feedback and User Experience
Clear visual feedback is essential in hand tracking games. When players make movements, providing immediate visual or sound cues whether through hand animations, on screen feedback, highlighting their  actions or playing a sound helps them stay engaged and understand how their movements are being interpreted by the system. This feedback not only enhances immersion but also guides players, allowing them to correct or refine their actions in real time. Since there is no way of providing haptic feedback to the player, this is a really important part of creating a game that makes use of hand tracking. 

## Customization and Accessibility
Not all players have the same level of comfort or skill when using hand tracking, so it’s important to provide customizable options to ensure everyone can enjoy the game. Offering adjustable hand sensitivity will allow players to fine tune the tracking to their individual needs, whether they prefer more responsive gestures or need more subtle tracking. In this case I would recommend having multiple control schemes to give players the freedom to interact with the game in ways that feel natural to them.
