# Professional Documents
These documents are group documents, in this readme I will describe my contribution to these documents.

- [1 Pager](01.%20Secrets%20of%20Ignacios%201-pager.pdf):
  - The games concept was made up by me, it got further worked out in this document. I worked on the unique selling points and game summary.
- [10 Pager](02.%20Secrets%20of%20Ignacios%2010-page%20GDD.pdf)
  - I have worked on multiple subjects, some are:
    - Spell casting mechanic
    - Core loop
    - Aesthetic
    - Targer audience
    - Controls
    - Player feedback
- [Project Plan](03.%20Secrets%20of%20Ignacios%20Project%20Plan.pdf)
  - No notable individual contributions
- [Dragons Den Presentation](05.%20Rogue%20Ape%20Dragons%20den%202.pdf)
  - I have made the whole presentation except for the dia with the picture of the book (3rd to last slide), this is the second version of this presentation.
  - I have done a practice pitch with the old presentation and received feedback on this presentation [which can be read here](06.%20Presentation%20Feedback.md). I presented the practice pitch on my own.
  - After receiving this feedback the presentation has been completely changed, at first it had a focus on the story and less on the machanics, I have completely flipped this around.
  - I have presented this presentation during the dragons den together with Loes. Here we again received feedback [which can be found here](06.%20Presentation%20Feedback.md) (this is the same document as the previously mentioned feedback document).
  - I don't see myself as a good presenter, so I took the role of doing it this time around to practice my presenting skills.
  - The link to the trailer can be found [here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IPyjD-FOuo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IPyjD-FOuo) since the video won't be able to play in pdf format. Credit to Rick for making the trailer.
