# Project Management
For this project I assumed a leading role for project management (Which I normally wouldn't do). To fulfill this position I have set up our git environment, by creating the repository and projects scrum board, linking them and creating branch rules to prevent us from ruining our repository. I also added the code convention and manifesto, by doing this I created a well organized workspace.

When group members have git related questions or questions about the code convention, I will help to resolve them.
