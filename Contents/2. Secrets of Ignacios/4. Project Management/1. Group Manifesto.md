## Rules

1. Democracy is the way. All members will vote on a given issue or concept. A minor majority is required to pass.
    1. A member can vote in the following ways: For, Against or Abstain.
    2. A member must Always vote. That way, their voice is heard.
    3. Any member can call a vote, for whatever reason. Unless there is major reason to indicate that it would be detrimental, it is binding.
    4. If it is detrimental to the project, a veto may be called, given adequate reason. Deleting the Git repository would be an (extreme) example.
2. Be on time. Attendance will be tracked by virtue of memory, but frequent absences or tardiness will be addressed. If there is a good reason for absence, let the group know.
3. Use the Project Management System. If you are working on something, it should be on the board. This allows everyone to stay up to date with what needs doing.
4. Be honest about everyones work. Be constructive, but fair.
