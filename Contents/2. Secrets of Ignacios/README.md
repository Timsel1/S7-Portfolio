# Secrets of Ignacios
Secrets of Ignacios is a continuation of my first week project, where I wanted to focus on hand tracking and gesture recognition. After this first week we went into the group projects, we got to hear about all the available projects, but I wanted to ceate my own project. When I mentioned this, I was allowed to present the work I did together with my duo partner and pitch the game idea we came up with, if enough people showed interest we might get the green light to work on this game idea. The game idea ended up peaking enough peoples interest and I got to work on something that was really interesting to me.
