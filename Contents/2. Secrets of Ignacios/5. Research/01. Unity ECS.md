# Can Unity ECS be used to improve performance in Secrets of Ignacios?
Our spells currently work by instantiating and destroying spell prefabs, this is an expansive operation and in some cases causes the game to lag. Unity's ECS system is optimized to handle a lot of entities 
which can resemble game objects and is optimized for performance. But is it usable with the current spell system that has been build?

## How does ECS work?
Unity's Entity Component System (ECS) makes use of Data Oriented Programming (DOP) that focusses on optimizing performance by using modern CPU architectures. Traditional Object Oriented Programming (OOP), where scripts (like MonoBehaviours) are attached to GameObjects, ECS uses a system that separates Entities, Components, and Systems to achieve high performance and scalability.
- Entities:
  - Entities serve as containers for components. An Entity represents a "tag" or "ID" components can be attached to. They are lightweight and have no data or behavior themselves. 
- Components:
  - These are simple data structures, that hold only the data of an entity. For example, a Position component might store an entity's position in the world as float3 x, y, z.
- Systems:
  - Systems contain all the logic that gives components their behaviour. Systems handle multiple entities at once based on their components. Systems can run in parallel using Unity's Job System, which significantly improves performance.

This separation of data (components) from logic (systems) allows Unity ECS to process large numbers of entities with minimal overhead, unlike the MonoBehaviour system, which requires individual GameObject updates.
