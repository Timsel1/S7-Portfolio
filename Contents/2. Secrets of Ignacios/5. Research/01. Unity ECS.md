# Can Unity ECS be used to improve performance in Secrets of Ignacios?
Our spells currently work by instantiating and destroying spell prefabs, this is an expansive operation and in some cases causes the game to lag. Unity's ECS system is optimized to handle a lot of entities 
which can resemble game objects and is optimized for performance. But is it usable with the current spell system that has been build?

## How does ECS work?
ECS doesn't work like object oriented programming (OOP), like the monobehaviour scripts in unity, it is uses data oriented programming (DOP)

Unity's Entity Component System (ECS) is a Data-Oriented Design (DOD) approach to game development that focuses on optimizing performance by leveraging modern CPU architectures. Unlike Unity's traditional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) model, where scripts (MonoBehaviours) are attached to GameObjects, ECS operates on a system that separates Entities, Components, and Systems to achieve high performance and scalability.

Entities: These are lightweight, identifier-like objects. They have no data or behavior themselves but serve as containers for components. An Entity can be thought of as a "tag" or "ID" to which components are attached.

Components: These are simple, plain data structures (often structs) that hold only the data relevant to an entity. For example, a Position component might store an entity's position in the world as float3 x, y, z.

Systems: These contain all the logic that acts on components. Unlike MonoBehaviour scripts that run methods like Update, Systems process batches of entities that have specific components. Systems can operate in parallel using Unity's Job System, which significantly boosts performance.

This separation of data (components) from logic (systems) allows Unity ECS to process large numbers of entities with minimal overhead, unlike the MonoBehaviour system, which requires individual GameObject updates.
