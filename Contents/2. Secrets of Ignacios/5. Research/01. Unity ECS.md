# Can Unity ECS be used to improve performance in Secrets of Ignacios?
Our spells currently work by instantiating and destroying spell prefabs, this is an expansive operation and in some cases causes the game to lag. Unity's ECS system is optimized to handle a lot of entities 
which can resemble game objects and is optimized for performance. But is it usable with the current spell system that has been build?

## How does ECS work?
Unity's Entity Component System (ECS) makes use of Data Oriented Programming (DOP) that focusses on optimizing performance by using modern CPU architectures. Traditional Object Oriented Programming (OOP), where scripts (like MonoBehaviours) are attached to GameObjects, ECS uses a system that separates Entities, Components, and Systems to achieve high performance and scalability.
- Entities:
  - Entities serve as containers for components. An Entity represents a "tag" or "ID" components can be attached to. They are lightweight and have no data or behavior themselves. 
- Components:
  - These are simple data structures, that hold only the data of an entity. For example, a Position component might store an entity's position in the world as float3 x, y, z.
- Systems:
  - Systems contain all the logic that gives components their behaviour. Systems handle multiple entities at once based on their components. Systems can run in parallel using Unity's Job System, which significantly improves performance.

This separation of data (components) from logic (systems) allows Unity ECS to process large numbers of entities with minimal overhead, unlike the MonoBehaviour system, which requires individual GameObject updates.

## How to implement ECS in a project
- **Installing required packages:**  
To use ECS, multiple packages need to be installed. The necessary packages are Entities, Jobs, and Burst packages which can be found in the Unity package manager. These packages are the foundation of Unity's Data Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS). Entities enables ECS, Jobs facilitates multithreaded programming, and Burst optimizes computational performance.
- **Create Data Components:**  
Components in ECS store only data, not behavior. Define components as structs implementing IComponentData. By separating data from logic, ECS enables systems to operate efficiently on large amounts of entities, grouping similar data for optimal memory access patterns.

3. Build Entity Prefabs
Entities replace GameObjects in ECS. Use the EntityManager to create entities dynamically or convert GameObjects into entities using the ConvertToEntity MonoBehaviour. This conversion allows you to leverage Unity’s editor while transitioning to an ECS architecture.

4. Develop Systems
Systems in ECS handle the logic applied to entities. They iterate over entities matching specific components and modify their data. Systems are central to ECS, enabling modular, scalable, and high-performance logic execution. Define systems using SystemBase or IJobComponentSystem to process entities efficiently.

5. Optimize with Jobs and Burst
Leverage the Jobs system to run tasks across multiple threads. This parallel processing is ideal for heavy computations, like physics or AI. Use the Burst compiler to transform C# code into highly optimized machine code, maximizing performance on supported platforms.

6. Test and Debug
The Entity Debugger and Unity Profiler are essential tools for ECS development. The Entity Debugger allows you to inspect entities, components, and systems in real time. Use it to verify system behavior and debug issues. The Profiler identifies performance bottlenecks and ensures your ECS implementation runs efficiently.

7. Integrate with Existing Systems
If you’re transitioning from a GameObject-based architecture, begin by converting performance-critical parts of your game to ECS. Maintain compatibility by using hybrid systems, where GameObjects and entities coexist. Gradual integration minimizes risk and ensures a smoother development process.
