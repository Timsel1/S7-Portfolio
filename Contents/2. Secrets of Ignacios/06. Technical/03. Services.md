# Services
Here the scripts that can be found in the services folder are explained. This entails the `ServiceLocator` script and the `ObjectPooler` script.

## ServiceLocator
The `ServiceLocator` class is a centralized system for managing services within the game. It uses a static dictionary to store and retrieve services by their type, enabling global access without direct dependencies. 
This was necessary in specific cases like spell projectile scripts that need to return the instanced prefab back to the object pooler.

### Functionality

- `RegisterService<T>(T service)`:
   - The `RegisterService<T>` method allows adding services to the locator.
   - Throws an exception if the service type is already registered, preventing duplicate registrations.
- `GetService<T>()`:
   - The `GetService<T>` method provides access to a registered service by its type.
   - Throws an exception if the requested service type is not found.

### Usage
Create an empty object in your scene, add the `ServiceLocator` script to this object so it can be used as a reference where needed.

- **Registering a Service**:
  ```c#
  // A reference to the ServiceLocator is necessary
  // Services NEED to be registered in the Awake() method
  
  [SerializeField] private ServiceLocator _serviceLocator;

  private void Awake()
  {
    _serviceLocator.RegisterService(this);
  }

  ```

- **Retrieving a Service**:
  ```c#
  // In this case the object pooler is used as an example
  // Services NEED to be retrieved after the awake call is done, 
  // since services are registered in awake and might not be available for retrieval at this point

  private ObjectPooler _objectPooler;
  
  private void Start()
  {
    _objectPooler = ServiceLocator.GetService<ObjectPooler>();
  }
  ```

## ObjectPooler

The `ObjectPooler` class is a system for managing object pools (Mostly used for spell projectiles). It is designed to optimize performance by reusing game objects instead of instantiating and destroying them repeatedly.

### Functionality

- `Awake()`:
   - Registers itself with the `ServiceLocator` to allow global access.
- `CreatePool(string objectType, GameObject prefab, int initialSize)`:
   - The `CreatePool` method initializes a pool of inactive game objects for a specific type.
   - Automatically ensures the pool size matches the required count.
   - Parameters:
     - `objectType`: Name of the pool and key that is used for the dictionary.
     - `prefab`: The object that is added to the pool.
     - `initialSize`: The size of the pool. 
- `GetObject(string poolKey, GameObject prefab, Transform transform)`:
   - The `GetObject` method fetches an object from the pool, activating and positioning it as needed.
   - If the pool is empty, a new object is instantiated and returned.
   - Parameters:
     - `poolKey`: Name of the pool and key that is used for the dictionary.
     - `prefab`: The object that is retrieved from the pool.
     - `transform`: The position and rotation you want the pooled object to spawn at. 
- `ReturnObject(string objectType, GameObject obj)`:
   - The `ReturnObject` method deactivates and returns an object to its respective pool, resetting its position.
   - Parameters:  
     - `objectType`: Name of the pool and key that is used for the dictionary.
     - `obj`: The object that is returned to the pool.

### Usage

- **Creating Pools**:  
  Pools are automatically created during the `Awake` method for all configured spells:
  ```c#
  foreach (var spell in _spells)
            {
                if (!spell._duoSpell)
                    CreatePool(spell._primaryConfig._spellPrefab.name,
                        spell._primaryConfig._spellPrefab,
                        spell._primaryConfig._poolSize);
                else
                {
                    CreatePool(spell._primaryConfig._spellPrefab.name,
                        spell._primaryConfig._spellPrefab,
                        spell._primaryConfig._poolSize);

                    CreatePool(spell._secondaryConfig._spellPrefab.name,
                        spell._secondaryConfig._spellPrefab,
                        spell._secondaryConfig._poolSize);
                }
            }
  ```
  If you want to use the object pooler for other objects than spells, the `CreatePool` can be called like this:
  ```c#
  // It is recommended to use object.name to prevent spelling errors
  // If a name has "(clone)" attached to it, because the object was
  // instantiated, the object pooler will automatically handle this
  
  [SerializeField] private ObjectPooler _objectPooler;

  _objectPooler.CreatePool(object.name, object, /*Pool size*/);
  ``` 

- **Retrieving an Object**:  
Get object from the created pool.
  ```c#
  [SerializeField] private ObjectPooler _objectPooler;
  
  GameObject obj = _objectPooler.GetObject(object.name, object, /*Transform of the spawn point you want*/);
  ```

- **Returning an Object**:  
Return objects to the pool, make sure to do this after your criteria have been met (e.g. time, collision or another event).
  ```c#
  [SerializeField] private ObjectPooler _objectPooler;

  _objectPooler.ReturnObject(object.name, object);
  ```
