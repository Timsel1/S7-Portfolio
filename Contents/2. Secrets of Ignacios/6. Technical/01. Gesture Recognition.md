# Gesture Recognition
To check for Gestures the [Unity XR Hands package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.hands@1.5/manual/index.html) is used. The limitation of this package is that only one handed gestures are recognised, the gestures needed to cast spells are made with 2 hands. To solve this issue a gesture system needed to be created that can recognise 2 handed gestures. For this reason the `HandShape` enum, `Gesture` scriptable object and `SequenceManager` script were created.

## HandShape enum
This enum is used in the `Gesture` class, this way 2 handshapes can create 1 gesture. It is also used in the `SequenceChecker` script to see if the 2 handshapes that are held are a valid gesture.

## Gesture scriptable object
This scriptable object is what defines a gesture for a spell, it is made up of the gesture's name, 2 hand shapes (left and right), the max distance the hands can have between them in the X, Y and Z direction, a color and a visual effect prefab (this prefab is only required for the element gestures not the start, quick cast, cancel or spell type gestures). A spell is made up of 3 of these gestures and always starts with the start gesture.

## SequenceManager script
The `SequenceManager` script handles gesture based spellcasting mechanics in the VR environment. It manages hand positions, gestures, and sequences of gestures the sequence later gets validated so the player is able to cast spells, working in conjunction with other systems like visual effects and the spell manager.

### Resposibilities
- Gesture Recognition:  
    Tracks the state of both left and right hands using HandShape values.
    Matches the current hand shapes against a predefined list of gestures (`_allGestures`).
    Validates gestures based on hand distance and calls appropriate handlers.
- Sequence Management:  
    Maintains a list of validated gestures (`_validatedGestures`) as part of a sequence.
    Manages events triggered at various points in the sequence lifecycle (start, cancel, quick cast, etc.).

### Functionality
- `HandDistanceCheck(Gesture gesture)`:  
    - Checks if the hands meet the distance criteria defined in the gesture.
    - Validates the gesture by calling `OnDistanceValidated()`.
- `OnDistanceValidated()`:  
    - Adds validated gestures to `_validatedGestures`.
    - Triggers appropriate visual effects and events.
- `HandleOnSpellValidated()`:  
    - Clears `_ValidatedGestures` and resets the sequence when a spell is successfully cast.
- `HandleOnSpellFailed()`:  
    - Clears `_ValidatedGestures`, resets the sequence, and invokes the event to disable VFX on hands when no spell is matched.
- `CheckGestures()`:  
    - Compares current hand shapes (`_leftHandShape` and `_rightHandShape`) with the list of all gestures.
    - Sets `_currentGesture` if a match is found. This is called on a untiy event on the `StaticHandGesture` script.
- `SetRightHandShape()` / `SetLeftHandShape()`:  
    - Activates the hand shape based on a string input. Is called on a untiy event on the `StaticHandGesture` script.
- `TurnOffRightHandShape()` / `TurnOffLeftHandShape()`:  
    - Deactivates the hand shape and resets validation. Is called on a untiy event on the `StaticHandGesture` script.

## Usage
### Create a new gesture
1. To create a new gesture use one of the available hand shapes[^1] and hand poses[^2] or create your own, by following the [XR Hands manual for creating custom gestures](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.hands@1.5/manual/gestures/define-a-gesture.html). 

|Hand Shape Example|Hand Pose Example|
|-|-|

2. Create a new gesture scriptable object, by right clicking in your files clicking Create -> Scriptable Objects -> Gesture. Fill in all necessary fields (Effect prefab is only necessary for elements).

3. **Optional:** If you want to use a new hand shape go to the `HandShape` enum and add a new hand shape. 
4. When using the player rig prefab, open the gesture detection child object and either duplicate an existing object or create a new empty object and add the `StaticHandGesture` script as a component for the right and left hand.
5. Drag in references to the object with the `SequenceManager` script and select the methods as depicted in the image below (the order of the methods matter, so use the exact order as in the image). In hand shape or pose, select your new shape or pose

### Bind Gesture scriptable objects to XR Hands Gestures
To bind the XR Hands gestures to the scriptable object gestures the `SetRightHandShape()` / `SetLeftHandShape()` methods are used. Based on your gesture scriptable object fill in the hand shape from the `HandShape` enum you want to use for each hand. 
#### example
If we take the earlier Air gesture as an example, you should fill in "Air" as the parameter in the marked method from the image below.

## Footnotes
[^1]: Hand shapes are responsible for finger positions, you can set the shapes, the upper and lower thresholds and the desire for the position per finger. Desire 1 means it has to be the pose you set desire 0 means it is the opposite of the pose you set. E.g. full curl with desire 1, means you want the finger to be fully curled, desire 0 means you want the finger to be straight.
[^2]: Hand poses are responsible for checking the orientation of the hand (they are not always necessary). A reference to the hand shape is required.
