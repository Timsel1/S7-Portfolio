# Interactale System
To make spells interact with the world around the player the interactable system was created. It contains the `Interactable` script was created as a base. From here the 
`FireInteratable`, `WaterInteractable`, 
`WindInteractable` and `EarthInteractable` scripts have inherited the `Interactable` abstract class. These 4 calsses all have their own sub classes.
- `FireInteratable`:
  - `PersistentFire`
  - `DestructiveBurning`
- `WaterInteractable`:
  - `Fillable`
  - `Washable`
- `WindInteractable`:
  - `Blowable`
  - `Turnable` 
  - `Spinnable`
- `EarthInteractable`:
  - `Resizable`
  - `ResizeState` (Enum)

## Interactables
The `Interactables` class is an abstract base class that serves as a blueprint for objects that can interact with spells. It extends from `MonoBehaviour`, making it compatible with Unity's game object system. This class defines a standard structure for handling interactions and provides core functionality that other specific interactable objects can implement.

### Functionality
- **Spell Receiver Reference**:
  - The class contains a serialized field `_spellReceiver`, which is meant to hold a reference to a component responsible for handling spell interactions.
- **Abstract Methods**:
  - `Awake()`:  
    A method that is called when the object is first activated in the scene. This can be used for initialization tasks.
  - `OnDestroy()`:  
    A method that is invoked when the object is being destroyed, allowing for clean-up and resource management.
  - `HandleSpellReceived(string spellType)`:  
    An abstract method that must be implemented to handle the reception of a spell, taking in the type of spell as a string parameter.

### Usage
This class acts as a foundational component for objects that need to react to spells in a game. Derived classes should implement the `Awake`, `OnDestroy`, and `HandleSpellReceived` methods to provide specific behaviour related to their interaction with spells. The `_spellReceiver` field can be used to reference components that manage spell detection, casting, or effects. By using this abstract base class, you ensure a consistent structure for spell-related interactions across different game objects.

## FireInteractable 
The `FireInteractable` class is an abstract class that extends `Interactables`, designed specifically for objects that interact with fire and water-based spells. It provides additional functionality for managing fire effects, including handling spell receptions related to fire and water. This class adds behaviour for ignition, dousing, and visual effects associated with fire interactions.

### Functionality
- `Awake()`:  
  Overrides the `Awake` method from `Interactables`. It subscribes to the `OnSpellReceived` event from the spell receiver.
- `OnDestroy()`:  
  Overrides the `OnDestroy` method from `Interactables`. It unsubscribes from the `OnSpellReceived` event to prevent memory leaks.
- `HandleSpellReceived(string spellType)`:  
  Handles incoming spell interactions. If a fire spell (`"Fire"`) is received, it triggers the `OnFire()` method, and if a water spell (`"Water"`) is received, it triggers `OnDouse()`. It also invokes `OnIgnitionToggle` based on the current state.
- `OnFire()`:  
  Abstract method that defines the behaviour when the object ignites.
- `OnDouse()`:  
  Abstract method that defines the behaviour when the fire is extinguished.

### Usage
The `FireInteractable` class provides a template for objects that need to respond to fire and water spells, implementing behaviour for igniting and extinguishing. Derived classes must implement the `OnFire()` and `OnDouse()` methods to define specific responses to these spell interactions. The `OnIgnitionToggle` event can be used to notify other parts of the game system when the fire state changes, and the `VisualEffect` fields manage visual feedback for these interactions.

## PersistentFire 
The `PersistentFire` class is a concrete implementation of the `FireInteractable` abstract class, designed to represent objects that maintain a fire state persistently. This class extends the functionality of `FireInteractable` by providing specific behaviour for handling fire interactions, including the ability to start on fire and manage visual effects related to the fire state.

### Functionality 
- `Start()`:  
  This method is called when the object is first initialized. It stops any visual effects and sets default values, such as preventing the object from being destroyed.
- `OnFire()`:  
  Implements the behaviour when the fire is triggered, setting the fire state and playing the appropriate visual effects.
- `OnDouse()`:  
  Implements the behaviour when the fire is extinguished, updating the fire state and stopping the fire effects.

### Usage
`PersistentFire` can be dragged onto objects that can be on fire without being destroyed, like toches and fire pits. Upon initialization, it checks if it should start with fire, triggering the `OnFire()` method accordingly. This class ensures that fire interactions are consistently handled and visually represented, with control over fire effects and states.

## DestructiveBurning Class
The `DestructiveBurning` class is a concrete implementation of the `FireInteractable` abstract class, designed to represent objects that can burn and destructively transform once the fire state ends. This class extends the functionality of `FireInteractable` by adding mechanisms for handling timed burning, visual effects, object spawning upon burning, and cleanup after the fire is extinguished.

### Functionality
- `Awake()`:  
Overrides the base `Awake()` method to initialize the cancellation token source.
- `Start()`:  
Stops any effects when the object initializes.
- `OnDestroy()`:  
Overrides the base `OnDestroy()` method to handle cleanup and cancel any active processes.
- `Burning(CancellationToken token)`:  
Handles the timed burning process, playing visual effects and triggering actions after the burn time.
- `OnFire()`:  
Overrides the `OnFire()` method to start the burning process.
- `OnBurnt()`:  
Handles the logic once the burning process completes, including stopping effects, playing destruction effects, and optionally spawning objects.
- `OnDouse()`:  
Overrides the `OnDouse()` method to handle extinguishing the fire, stopping effects, and resetting states.

### Usage
`DestructiveBurning` can be dragged onto objects that can be on fire and should be destroyed after some time. When fire is applied, it starts a timed burning effect, after which it plays destruction effects and either deactivates the object or spawns contained objects. This class manages both visual feedback and game state changes during burning and extinguishing, providing a clear and consistent behavior for destructible objects.

## WaterInteractable 
The `WaterInteractable` class is an abstract extension of the `Interactables` class, designed for objects that respond to water-based spell interactions. This class introduces functionality for handling repeated water spell effects, such as splashing.

### Functionality
- `Awake()`:  
  Subscribes to the `OnSpellReceived` event and initializes the cancellation token source.
- `OnDestroy()`:  
  Unsubscribes from the `OnSpellReceived` event and disposes of the cancellation token source to prevent memory leaks.
- `HandleSpellReceived(string spellType)`:  
  Processes incoming spell interactions. If the spell type is `"Water"`, it triggers the `Splashed()` method.
  - `Splashed()`:  
    An abstract method that must be implemented by derived classes to define behavior when a water spell is received.

### Usage
`WaterInteractable` provides a framework for objects that react to water spells. Derived classes should implement the `Splashed()` method to define specific responses to water interactions, such as triggering effects or modifying object states. The `_spellInterval` field can be used to control the frequency of water spell effects, and the cancellation token ensures that asynchronous processes are safely managed during the object's lifecycle.

## Fillable 
The `Fillable` class is a concrete implementation of the `WaterInteractable` abstract class, designed for objects that can be filled with water through repeated water spell interactions. It introduces mechanics for managing the filling process, tracking the fill state, and triggering events upon completion.

### Functionality
- `onFilled`:  
  An event triggered when the object becomes fully filled, passing the filled state as a parameter.
- `Fill(CancellationToken token)`:  
  An asynchronous method that gradually fills the object over time, incrementing the content level and respecting the `_spellInterval`. If the object reaches its maximum capacity, it triggers the `onFilled` event.
- `Splashed()`:  
  Overrides the base `Splashed()` method to mark the object as splashed and initiate the filling process. Logs a debug message to indicate that the filling process has started.

### Usage
The `Fillable` can be dragged onto objects that respond to water spells by incrementally filling their content. When a water spell hits the object, the `Splashed()` method triggers the `Fill()` process, which continues until the object is filled or the interaction is canceled. The `_contentMax` and `_contentFilled` fields track the filling progress, while the `onFilled` event notifies other game systems when the object is fully filled. The class ensures smooth and interruptible filling behavior using a cancellation token.

## Washable 
The `Washable` class is a concrete implementation of the `WaterInteractable` abstract class, representing objects that can be cleaned with water spells. It handles the cleaning process by reducing grime on the object and updating its visual state in real-time using a shader graph.

### Functionality
- `Wash(CancellationToken token)`:  
    An asynchronous method that simulates the cleaning process by gradually reducing grime, updating the shader to reflect progress, and waiting for the interval defined by `_spellInterval`. If the cleaning completes, the object is marked as cleaned and deactivated.
- `Splashed()`:  
    Overrides the base `Splashed()` method to initiate the cleaning process when the object is splashed by water.

### Usage
The `Washable` class can be dragged onto objects that can be progressively cleaned with water spells. When splashed, the cleaning process begins, decrementing the grime and updating the visual state through the `_noise` material's shader property (`_Fade_Amount`). Once all grime is removed, the object is marked as clean and optionally deactivated. The cleaning process is smooth and interruptible, leveraging Unity's `UniTask` system for asynchronous operations.

## WindInteractable 
The `WindInteractable` class is an abstract extension of the `Interactables` class, designed to handle interactions with wind-based spells. It provides a framework for objects affected by wind spells, triggering specific behaviors and events when wind interactions occur.

### Functionality 
- `onBlown`:  
  An event triggered when the object is blown by wind, passing the `_isBlown` state to subscribed listeners.
- `Awake()`:  
  Subscribes to the `OnSpellReceived` event of the `_spellReceiver` to handle wind spell interactions.
- `OnDestroy()`:  
  Unsubscribes from the `OnSpellReceived` event to prevent memory leaks.
- `HandleSpellReceived(string spellType)`:  
  Processes incoming spell interactions. If the spell type is `"Wind"`, it triggers the `Blown()` method and raises the `onBlown` event.
- `Blown()`:  
  An abstract method to be implemented by derived classes, defining specific behavior when the object is blown by wind.

### Usage
The `WindInteractable` class serves as a base for objects that need to respond to wind spells. Derived classes must implement the `Blown()` method to specify how the object behaves when affected by wind, such as spinning, moving, or reacting to force.  
By leveraging the `onBlown` event, other game systems can respond dynamically to wind interactions, ensuring that the behavior is modular and extensible.

## Turnable 
The `Turnable` class is a concrete implementation of the `WindInteractable` abstract class. It represents objects that can rotate when affected by wind spells, simulating a turning or rotating motion over a defined duration. The object cannot turn more than 360 degrees.

### Functionality
- `FixedUpdate()`:  
  Continuously checks if the object is affected by wind (`_isBlown`) and triggers the `Turn()` method to apply the rotation.
- `Blown()`:  
  Overrides the base method to initialize the rotation process by setting the start and target rotations and resetting the elapsed time.
- `Turn()`:  
  Gradually rotates the object from `_startRotation` to `_targetRotation` using `Quaternion.Slerp` over the duration defined by `_turnDuration`. The rotation stops when the process completes.

## Usage
The `Turnable` class can be dragged onto objects that need to rotate smoothly when hit by wind spells. When a wind spell affects the object, the `Blown()` method initializes the rotation parameters, and the `Turn()` method executes the rotation incrementally. The rotation logic ensures smooth transitions and can handle multiple wind spell interactions without interruption.

## Spinnable 
The `Spinnable` class is a concrete implementation of the `WindInteractable` abstract class, designed for objects that can spin when influenced by wind spells. It simulates rotational motion with configurable speed, deceleration, and axis of rotation, creating a dynamic and realistic spinning effect.

### Functionality
- `onSpinning`:  
  An event triggered when the spinning state changes, notifying listeners if the object starts or stops spinning.
- `FixedUpdate()`:
  - Gradually decreases speed using the deceleration rate when not affected by wind.
  - Applies rotational motion to the object based on `_currentSpeed` and `_rotationAxis`.
  - Handles transitions between spinning and non-spinning states.
- `Blown()`:
  - Increases the rotational speed by `_hitForce`, capping it at `_maxSpeed`.
  - Sets `_isSpinning` to true if the object begins spinning and invokes the `onSpinning` event.

### Usage
The `Spinnable` can be dragged onto objects that need to react dynamically to wind spells by spinning. It handles the interaction logic, including the initial force from wind, continuous spinning, and gradual deceleration when the wind effect stops.

## Blowable Class
The `Blowable` class is a concrete implementation of the `WindInteractable` abstract class. It is designed for objects that react to wind spells by entering a "blown" state. The state can be temporary or persistent, controlled by configurable parameters.

### Functionality:
- `onObjectBlown`:  
  An event triggered when the blown state changes, notifying listeners about the state transition.
- `FixedUpdate()`:
  - Continuously checks if the object should exit the blown state when `_temporaryBlown` is true.
  - Resets the blown state after `_blownDuration` has elapsed.
- `Blown()`:
  - Activates the blown state.
  - Invokes the `onObjectBlown` event to notify listeners.
  - Resets `_elapsedTime` to prepare for tracking the blown duration.
- `EndBlown()`:
  - Deactivates the blown state.
  - Invokes the `onObjectBlown` event to notify listeners.

### Usage
The `Blowable` class can be dragged onto objects that temporarily or permanently react to wind spells. It is particularly useful for creating interactive or reactive game elements that change their behavior when influenced by wind.

# EarthInteractable Class

## Description:
The `EarthInteractable` class is an abstract base class for objects that respond to earth-related spells, such as "Grow" or "Shrink." It extends the `Interactables` class and provides foundational functionality for handling earth-based interactions in the game.

### Functionality
- `Awake()`:
  - Subscribes the `HandleSpellReceived` method to the `OnSpellReceived` event from `_spellReceiver`. This ensures that the object reacts to incoming spells.
- `OnDestroy()`:
  - Unsubscribes `HandleSpellReceived` from the event to prevent memory leaks or unintended behavior when the object is destroyed.
- `HandleSpellReceived(string spellType)`:
  - Acts as the main handler for earth-related spells.
  - Logs the type of spell received for debugging purposes.
  - Based on the `spellType`, updates the corresponding state fields and triggers the `Touched()` method:
    - **Debug**: For debugging purposes; allows testing of behaviors in the editor.
    - **Grow**: Sets `_isGrowSpellActive` to `true` and calls `Touched()`.
    - **Shrink**: Sets `_isShrinkSpellActive` to `true` and calls `Touched()`.
- `Touched()`:
  - An abstract method to be implemented by derived classes. This is invoked whenever the object interacts with an earth spell, allowing for customized behavior.

## Usage
The `EarthInteractable` class can be dragged onto objects that need to respond to earth-based spells, such as growing, shrinking, or other related interactions. Derived classes implement the `Touched()` method to define specific behaviors for each type of interaction.
