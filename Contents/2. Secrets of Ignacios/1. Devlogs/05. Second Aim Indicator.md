# Second Aim Indication System
Since the first version of activating the aim indicator wasn't received well, a second activation version will be implemented and tested.

## How did I solve this?
I didn't need to do any of the designing work this time, since a group member came with the idea to make a charge time for spells. This way the players can do the normal casting gesture
and then have some time to correctly aim their spells. I just had to update the game's logic and add a simple timer, while the vfx for the charge were being made.

## What is the result?
A second indicator system has been implemented for single fire spells. It gives the player time to aim their spells and should improve the user experience.

## What is the quality of the result?
The indicator has been tested by the group, teachers and during [the second playtest](../2.%20Playtests/06.%20Test%20Report%20Second%20Playtest.md). It was well received and definetly an improvement, the feedback we received about this feature was that people wanted the timer to be longer, so they have more time to aim, but we also heard the exact opposite, some people felt like it took too long to shoot and didn't need the extra time.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?
Based on the feedback, I would advice to introduce a cast time setting in the game where the player can adjust the chargetime themself. This way everyone can play the way they like and maybe even reduce the time when they get better at the game.
