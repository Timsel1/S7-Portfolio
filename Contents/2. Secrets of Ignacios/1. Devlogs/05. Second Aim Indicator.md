# Second Aim Indication System
Since the first version of activating the aim indicator wasn't received well, a second activation version will be implemented and tested.

## How did I solve this?
I didn't need to do any of the designing work this time, since a group member came with the idea to make a charge time for spells. This way the players can do the normail casting gesture
and then have some time to correctly aim their spells.
