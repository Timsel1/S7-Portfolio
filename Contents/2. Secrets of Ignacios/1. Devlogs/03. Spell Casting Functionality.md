# Spell Casting Functionality
Now that the sequence recognition is working, players need to be able to use the spell they select.

## How did I solve this?
I created a class diagram for the whole sequence and casting system already, so I took casting spells into account when making this.

## What is the result?
By following the diagram I was able to cast spells when the casting gesture was recognised. I was able to cast from my right and left hand separately. The thing that cannot be seen in this diagram is how the spell gets the correct projectile and behaviour. Since a spell is a scriptable object a gameobject, which is the spellâ€™s projectile can be called and instantiated. This projectile has its own script which decides its behaviour. This way spell hehaviour and casting logic can be easily separated and should never interfere with each other.

## What is the quality of the result?
Being able to shoot spells was one thing but user experience has not been taken into account yet. 
During [the first playtest](../2.%20Playtests/03.%20Test%20Report%20First%20Playtest.md) we were told it is close to impossible to aim the spells. This was because the spells are shot from your palm, the rotation and position are copied from this transform object. This object never stays still and is angled down a bit from where people expected to shoot their spells.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?
The next step will be to improve user experience, by adding indicators people can use to aim their spells.
