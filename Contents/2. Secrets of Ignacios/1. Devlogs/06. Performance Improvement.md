# How can the performance of casting spells be improved?
Currently spells are cast by instantiating and destroying objects gathered from the spell scriptable object. These are very expansive operations to perform during runtime and in the case of the water spell will lag the game.

## How did I solve this?
During my advanced game design semester, I was introduced to the Entity Component System (ECS). One lecture featured a demonstration using a game developed by a teacher, showcasing how ECS enabled thousands of projectiles to be fired while maintaining great performance. I was interested in learning about this system so during the holidays I started to look into ECS, however I quickly found out that this system would not be a great fit, since it would require a complete overhaul of our current system.

Becasue of this I switched to a system I had know about for a bit longer but never actually tried to make, this was an object pooling system. I already knew that this system instantiates projectiles beforehand and activates/deactivates them when needed. This would be a great improvement on the current situation. This system would need 3 functionalities:
- First, creating an object pool
- Second, getting the correct projectile from the pool when needed
- Third, returning the projectile to the correct pool when needed

Since I would need multiple pools for the different projectiles, I decided to use a dictionary with a string as the key and a queue as the value, this way I could use the prefab names to create pools for not only spells but also anything else I needed.

If I wanted to intergrate this system into the game I would need to refactor my code, to make sure it stays object oriented. Currently the spell casting is done in the spell manager script

## What is the result?
