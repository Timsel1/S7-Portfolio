# How can the performance of casting spells be improved?
Currently spells are cast by instantiating and destroying objects gathered from the spell scriptable object. These are very expansive operations to perform during runtime and in the case of the water spell will lag the game.

## How did I solve this?
During my advanced game design semester, I was introduced to the Entity Component System (ECS). One lecture featured a demonstration using a game developed by a teacher, showcasing how ECS enabled thousands of projectiles to be fired while maintaining great performance. I was interested in learning about this system so during the holidays I started to look into ECS.

After having followed tutorials and making my first entities, I quickly found out that this system would not be a great fit, since it would require a complete overhaul of our current system.

Becasue of this I switched to a system I had know about for a bit longer but never actually tried to make, this was an object pooling system. I already knew that this system instantiates projectiles beforehand and activates/deactivates them when needed. This would be a great improvement on the current situation. This system would need 3 functionalities:
- First, creating an object pool
- Second, getting the correct projectile from the pool when needed
- Third, returning the projectile to the correct pool when needed

Since I would need multiple pools for the different projectiles, I decided to use a dictionary with a string as the key and a queue as the value, this way I could use the prefab names to create pools for not only spells but also anything else I needed.

If I wanted to intergrate this system into the game I would need to refactor my code, to make sure it stays object oriented. Currently the spell casting is done in the spell manager script, this would mean i would have to expand this script with even more casting logic, if I were to not refactor the code. This would not make sense and make the code messy. So I updated my uml with the new layout I had in mind.

## What is the result?
I have refactored our spell casting system and intergrated object pooling into this system. The result is that the player can now use spells without causing lag, also the code quility of the project has been improved and is now more structures and object oriented.

## What is the quality of the result?
before the implementation of the object pooler the game would start to lag when using the water spell for some time. This problem has been fixed with the implementation of the object pooler.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?
This system can be used if certain gameobjects need to be instantiated and destroyed repeatedly, so it can be used for more than just spells. The object pooler will probably not be updated, but will be used in more cases if needed.
