# Devlogs
In this directory my devlogs can be found. These devlogs contain my proecess whan making new features, from design to realisation and validation.

## Closed Tickets 
These closed tickets have either been comepletely done by me or I have contributed to finish the ticket. Most of these tickets do not have a devlog to go with them.   
**Note:** I did not name these tickets, credit for this goes to the scrum masters (some are named really badly)
