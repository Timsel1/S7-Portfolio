# How can an intuitive way of movement be created without the use of controllers in VR?
Since Secrets of Ignacios has no VR controller support and only uses hand tracking to play the game, a way to move your character needs to be implemented. Teleportation will be implemented, but we also want a more immersive way to move the player through the dungeon. I need to create a prototype for this movement option.

## How did I solve this?
I looked at some examples of other people and games trying to implement a movement mechanic other than teleportation with hand hand tracking, I also had an example of a system my
duo partner made for the 1 week project (Blast and Search). I found some options which change the teleport a bit to look like the player moves
([Rogue Ascent VR](https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/12cn17v/so_many_people_asked_us_how_do_you_move_in_a/), [Drakheir](https://youtu.be/qx02s4jYN7E)). A system where the player would point
their hand in the direction they would like to go and then lean your head into that direction ([Drakheir](https://youtu.be/qx02s4jYN7E?t=178)). 
Lastly I found a hand position based movement system ([Elin H√∂hler's system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqH_mKU2Nfk)). 

I decided to go with something similar to the last option, because the teleport variation is still just a teleport, we might be able to make this the default teleport eventually and
leaning your head seems less intuitive. People might also lean too much, this could be a risk for people falling over. The hand position option worked similar to the way the movement
in the 1 week project worked, it uses an anchor point and the hand position based on this point to move the player, as far as I can tell from the video. Sadly I couldn‚Äôt find something
similar with more explanation on the workings of this system, so I have to figure this out by myself.

# What is the result?
I have created a similar way of movement as in the video shown, but my version has some flaws. The anchor point is tied to the player‚Äôs camera at the moment, which means the anchor point moves with the head, if you turn your head while moving, your movement direction will change. There is also no motion sickness prevention in place, this feature should be added later. The gesture currently used is temporary but I have already seen people who have trouble creating this gesture with their hands, this is only a temporary issue and will be fixed once more recognised gestures are added to the game.

# What is the quality of the result?
The movement has been tested during our first playtest. The participants were game design students and a teacher. The results were expected, it‚Äôs not in a great state yet. People who filled in the survey answered the system wasn‚Äôt intuitive and most experienced at least a little bit of motion sickness. They did however tell us that when the anchor point would not be tied to the way your head moves it would be a lot better. There was also a suggestion made to make a way to turn the player, without needing them to turn in real life.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?
The next step will be to tie the anchor point to the players hands, the challenge with this is that it still needs to check for the distance and direction based on where the players hand is in comparison to the anchor point. This functionality will probably mean that when the player turns their head, the anchor point will stay in that location, meaning that if the player keeps the movement active, they can‚Äôt choose their direction, so a check is needed to either see if the anchor point is on screen, or the distance from the players hand is too large.
