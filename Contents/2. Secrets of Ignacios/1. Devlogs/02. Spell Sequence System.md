# Spell Sequence System
I need to create a system that recognises hand gestures made up of 2 hands, since the XR Hands package we use doesn’t have this functionality. It also needs to remember a sequence and check if the player knows a spell with this sequence. This is one of the most important systems in the game so it needs to be expandable and well thought out.

# How did I solve this?
I started by making a class diagram of how I thought this system would work. This didn’t seem like a difficult system at the start, 
I would just make a spell manager which would check the performed gestures and compare it to known spells after. The flaw in this design 
was that gestures were an enum, this would not work since a gesture was made up of 2 hands and couldn’t be directly translated to a value in this enum.

I rethought my approach and ended up with this system in the end (The class structure was made beforehand, most fields, properties and methods were added during development).

## What is the result?
A system that can recognise hand gestures individually and as a sequence has been added. There is also a way to add recognised spells to the player, so spells need to be unlocked and aren't recognised from the start.

This system currently only recognises a spell and doesn't give any feedback on wether you are using the correct sign/sequence besides console logs. The next step will be to give the player feedback on whether the gestures are recognised. This could easily be done with a couple lines of code.

## What is the quality of the result?
This system has been tested during [the first playtest](../2.%20Playtests/03.%20Test%20Report%20First%20Playtest.md) for responsiveness, ease of use and reliability. It received positive feedback and worked quite well, there was a small learning curve to getting the gestures correct, but after players got it once there were no further issues.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?
The next step will be to cast the current spell and complete the whole spell casting system. (The whole casting system was available during the playtest)
