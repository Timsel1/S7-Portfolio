# Reflection 
This semester has been a period of growth, I took on challenges that pushed me outside of my comfort zone and developed new skills. Reflecting on these experiences, 
I’ve identified some areas of growth.

## Personal Growth
How has this semester contributed to my personal development?

### Leadership and Responsibility
For the first time, I took on a leading role as the Git Master for our project. This role required me to set up the development environment, code convention and manifesto, something I had never done before. 
This felt like a big resposibility, since it was something that could impact the entire team's workflow. However, by using the knowledge I gained from our Git Master during the previous semester, I 
successfully set up the environment. This experience not only enhanced my technical abilities but also showed me I could take on a leading role in collaborative settings.

### Public Speaking and Presentations
This semester also provided me with several opportunities to improve my public speaking and presentation skills. I presented the Secrets of Ignacios pitch to the XR minor, followed by a stakeholder 
presentation and a Dragons' Den practice presentation and the actual presentation. These experiences were invaluable in helping me refine how I communicate ideas clearly and persuasively to different audiences. With each presentation, 
I became better at hiding how nervous I really was, learned to anticipate questions and adapt my delivery to fit the audience.  
The things I worked on regarding my presenting skills were:
- Communicate the idea clearly
- Act confident 
- Be prepared for questions
- Catering the presentation content to the audiece

#### XR Game Picth
This presentation was very informal, after announcing I wanted to work on my own idea instead of doing an industry project, I was allowed to pitch this game idea to the rest of the XR Minor. By showing the project
that was made in the week prior and telling about the game idea we managed to convince about half the students and were allowed to work on this game. 
- Communicate the idea clearly
- Act confident 
- Give potential things to work on, so the teachers know we can achieve the learning goals with this project (this one was specific to this presentation)

#### Stakeholder Presentation
The project needed a stakeholder, this stakeholder would be a gamedesign & technology teacher. This teacher was not familiar with the project so a presentation was needed. Since I was the person who came up with the
idea, I took the responsibility of pitching the idea to the stakeholder.
- Communicate the idea clearly
- Act confident 
- Be prepared for questions 

#### Dragons' Den Practice Pitch
The goal of this presentation was to practice what it would be to present for industry professionals, and get used to the nerves of presenting for a bigger audience. This pitch should convince professionals that
Secrets of Ignacios is worth investing in and has potential to be the next big thing. We would receive feedback on our presenting skills, presentation content and receive questions about things that weren't clear
in the presentatoin.
- Communicate the idea clearly
- Act confident
- Be prepared for questions
- Catering the presentation content to the audiece

#### Dragons' Den Pitch
The goal of this presentation was to present for industry professionals and convince them that Secrets of Ignacios is worth investing in and has potential to be the next big thing. We would receive feedback on 
our game, potential points of failure or success and receive questions about things that weren't clear in the presentatoin. At the end we would receive a yay or nay together with a reasoning behind the decision.
- Communicate the idea clearly
- Act confident
- Be prepared for questions
- Catering the presentation content to the audiece

## Technical Growth
This was my first time working with XR equipment. Diving into VR development, I learned about hand tracking, its capabilities and limitations. This hands on experience deepened my understanding of the 
technical aspects of XR development. I also gained insight into how to design for immersive experiences, which has broadened my perspective on the potential of XR in various applications.

## Getting an internship
Getting an intership was very easy this time around, I have used my connections to get a spot at ICT Group in Eindhoven before the semester had started. This meant I just needed to fill in my intenship proposal and
keep the company. To fill in my project propopsal I got together with my semester coach to discuss personal learning outcomes that I could work on during my internship, for all other things I got together with
my inetrnship supervisor and made sure to document every detail of the assignment I would work on. By doing this I got everything done on time. This is a big improvement from the previous times I was looking 
for an internship, the first time I couldn't find anything in time and the second time I was able to find something last minute.

## Looking Ahead

This semester has set a strong foundation for my future goals. The leadership and technical skills I developed will be invaluable in my career, particularly in roles that require collaborative 
problem solving and innovation. My improved public speaking skills will enhance my ability to advocate for ideas and projects, while my experience with XR development has inspired me to explore further 
possibilities in immersive technologies.

All these skills will be especially helpful during my internship, where I will work on a program for the Hololens 2, an AR device. During this internship I will need to communicate the project clearly to my 
assessors, present on multiple occasions and work with XR technoligy. I will need to lead my own project, by planning sprints and setting my own goals. I have worked on all these things either during this semester
or in previous ones.

## Self Assessment

    Be honest about areas where you could improve, such as consistency or depth of engagement.
    Consider what changes you’d make to optimize your learning experience in the future.
