# Reflection 
This semester has been a period of growth, I took on challenges that pushed me outside of my comfort zone and developed new skills. Reflecting on these experiences, 
I’ve identified some areas of growth.

## Personal Growth
How has this semester contributed to my personal development?

### Leadership and Responsibility
For the first time, I took on a leading role as the Git Master for our project. This role required me to set up the development environment, code convention and manifesto, something I had never done before. 
This felt like a big resposibility, since it was something that could impact the entire team's workflow. However, by using the knowledge I gained from our Git Master during the previous semester, I 
successfully set up the environment. This experience not only enhanced my technical abilities but also showed me I could take on a leading role in collaborative settings.

### Public Speaking and Presentations
This semester also provided me with several opportunities to improve my public speaking and presentation skills. I presented the Secrets of Ignacios pitch to the XR minor, followed by a stakeholder 
presentation and a Dragons' Den practice presentation and the actual presentation. These experiences were invaluable in helping me refine how I communicate ideas clearly and persuasively to different audiences. With each presentation, 
I became better at hiding how nervous I really was, learned to anticipate questions and adapt my delivery to fit the audience.  
The things I worked on regarding my presenting skills were:
- Communicate the idea clearly
- Act confident 
- Be prepared for questions
- Catering the presentation content to the audiece

#### XR Game Picth
This presentation was very informal, after announcing I wanted to work on my own idea instead of doing an industry project, I was allowed to pitch this game idea to the rest of the XR Minor. By showing the project
that was made in the week prior and telling about the game idea we managed to convince about half the students and were allowed to work on this game. 
- Communicate the idea clearly
- Act confident 
- Give potential things to work on, so the teachers know we can achieve the learning goals with this project (this one was specific to this presentation)

#### Stakeholder Presentation
The project needed a stakeholder, this stakeholder would be a gamedesign & technology teacher. This teacher was not familiar with the project so a presentation was needed. Since I was the person who came up with the
idea, I took the responsibility of pitching the idea to the stakeholder.
- Communicate the idea clearly
- Act confident 
- Be prepared for questions 

#### Dragons' Den Practice Pitch
The goal of this presentation was to practice what it would be to present for industry professionals, and get used to the nerves of presenting for a bigger audience. This pitch should convince professionals that
Secrets of Ignacios is worth investing in and has potential to be the next big thing. We would receive feedback on our presenting skills, presentation content and receive questions about things that weren't clear
in the presentatoin.
- Communicate the idea clearly
- Act confident
- Be prepared for questions
- Catering the presentation content to the audiece

#### Dragons' Den Pitch
The goal of this presentation was to present for industry professionals and convince them that Secrets of Ignacios is worth investing in and has potential to be the next big thing. We would receive feedback on 
our game, potential points of failure or success and receive questions about things that weren't clear in the presentatoin. At the end we would receive a yay or nay together with a reasoning behind the decision.
- Communicate the idea clearly
- Act confident
- Be prepared for questions
- Catering the presentation content to the audiece

## Technical Growth
This was my first time working with XR equipment. Diving into VR development, I learned about hand tracking, its capabilities and limitations. This hands on experience deepened my understanding of the 
technical aspects of XR development. I also gained insight into how to design for immersive experiences, which has broadened my perspective on the potential of XR in various applications (outside of gaming).

## Getting an internship
Getting an intership was very easy this time around, I have used my connections to get a spot at ICT Group in Eindhoven before the semester had started. This meant I just needed to fill in my intenship proposal and
keep the company. To fill in my project propopsal I got together with my semester coach to discuss personal learning outcomes that I could work on during my internship, for all other things I got together with
my inetrnship supervisor and made sure to document every detail of the assignment I would work on. By doing this I got everything done on time. This is a big improvement from the previous times I was looking 
for an internship, the first time I couldn't find anything in time and the second time I was able to find something last minute.

## Looking Ahead

This semester has set a strong foundation for my future goals. The leadership and technical skills I developed will be invaluable in my career, particularly in roles that require collaborative 
problem solving and innovation. My improved public speaking skills will enhance my ability to advocate for ideas and projects, while my experience with XR development has inspired me to explore further 
possibilities in immersive technologies.

All these skills will be especially helpful during my internship, where I will work on a program for the Hololens 2, an AR device. During this internship I will need to communicate the project clearly to my 
assessors, present on multiple occasions and work with XR technoligy. I will need to lead my own project, by planning sprints and setting my own goals. I have worked on all these things either during this semester
or in previous ones.

## Self Assessment
Overall I think I performed well, based on how little feedback I have received in total. Some points of imptrovement would be:
- I should have taken certain matters into my own hands, but didn't do this when I had the chance. I don't want to call anyone out so I will leave it at that. 
- I had left a small typo in our code convention, which changed the naming of our events from being pascal case to camel case. I didn't realise this until someone mentioned this. I should review these types of documents a bit more careful next time.
- Working on my portfolio is something I still need to improve a lot. I don't have any motivation to keep it up to date, which is why it is currently still lacking a lot of devlog (my last devlog is about an issue which was closed on october 29 2024). I'm going to work on this during my internship and have written how I will do this in my internship proposal.
- The standup meatings sometimes derailed a bit, making them take way longer than they needed to be. There were instances where I initiated this myself, eventhought I didn't always enjoy it when someone else did. Being more professional during a standup is something I can keep an eye on. 

### Portfolio
I personally didn't receive a lot of feedback during this semester, I took this as me doing a good job. The feedback I received on my portfolio was due to the teachers not understanding the structure of my portfolio, since I'm the only one working in markdown, me simply forgetting to link to a document or because I put off adding the DOT framework to my devlogs and research.

- Could link to all details of used research.
    - I thought I did this but I forgot.
- Show iterations of your steps, not only the end result.
    - Fair, I didn't record enough of the steps in between and improved this by the second and third review.
- Within the result you mention the playtest: Link to all evidence mentoined in a devlog. 
    - Again I thought I did this but I forgot.
- Claim your evidence and link to devlog: Is the test report written by you?
    - I did this, but it was missed by the teachers, so I explicitly wrote where they could find it in the Contents README file.
- Wat is er van jouw werk getest met Play test 2, komt nog niet duidelijk naar voren -->Wel  Goed uitgelegd in de review zelf.
   - I mentioned this, but it was missed by the teachers, so I explicitly wrote where they could find it in the Contents README file.
- Wat is nieuw? Maak dat duidelijk.
    - I have a readers guide, where all updated and new files are shared per delivery, I added this in the first iteration, thus it has been there the whole time. 
- Spell Aim Indicators. Tip: Geef een beschrijving van de analyse, realisatie en design van dit proces.
    - This devlog was not done by the time it was reviewed.

### Peer Feedback
I received some feedback from my peers during our [retrospectives](../../2.%20Secrets%20of%20Ignacios/3.%20Professional%20Documents/04.%20Retrospectives.md#sprint-3). It wasn't always as usefull and in most cases specific to this project, but there were some useful tips like:
- If you want a merge request to be done, ask a specific person because people are lazy and won’t respond to an “everyone”
    - Most of the time I assigned everyone as a reviewer, because of this no one would review my PR even after asking it multiple times in the standups. I can't say this issue was becasue of me, but I can start giving PRs to sepcific people to make sure they can get done faster.
- Explain code better
    - This is about one specific instance (so I was told) during the 5th sprint (during the holidays), after reading it back I see where the miscommunication happend and after the holidays I did explain it all in detail and in person. The handshape I meant was the handshape asset, but the handshape she ment was the handshape scriptable object, so this explaination didn't end up helping very much.

- Read research
    - I didn't read all the research documents if they weren't aimed at something I was doing/working on. because of this a misunderstanding came about. I'll make sure to read it all from now on.
- AB testen hand gestures of gestures pitchen bij groep voor implementatie
    - This one is aimed at usability, I shouldn't assume everyone can do a certain motion/gesture with their hands. I should test these kind of things before implementing them.

**Less useful feedback**
- Quick cast :’(
    - A bug was found with quick cast
- I hate the if statements with no { }
    - this refers to the example below. It is my prefered way to write this code and was allowed in the code convention, I even asked at the start of the project if anyone had any objection to this.
    ```c#
        if (argument)
            DoSomething();
    Versus

        if (argument)
        {
            DoSomething();
        }
    ```
- HandVfxManager.cs
    - This script was origionally not made by me, and was a problem. I refactored it so all the hand vfx were managed in this script, instead of it managing half of the hand vfx and even a visual effect of the magic circle, which had its own vfx class. After refactoring it it was still not liked very much, but all hand vfx were managed by this class now and magic circle vfx had been removed from this class.
