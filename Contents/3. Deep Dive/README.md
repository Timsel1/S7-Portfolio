# Deep Dive 
My deep dive project was to find out if dynamic movements can be detected with hand tracking in VR. I wanted to do more research on this topic since I already use static hand gestures for my group project and wanted to see if it add more depth the that project.

I did not want to use any other hardware than a VR headset since this was a selling point for the group project to keep the game (Secrets of Ignacios) accessable to as many people as possible.
