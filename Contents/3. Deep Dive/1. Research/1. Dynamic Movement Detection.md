# Can dynamic movements be detected with hand tracking in VR?
In secrets of Igancios I have created a system that can already recognise a sequence of gestures a user performs. These gestures are all static hand poses. I want to find out if I can recognise movement to, in this case, cast spells. Since my group got feedback to maybe use movements to change the way a spell works, or use our current cast gesture and instead of just performing the gesture you would actually have to push it forward for it to work.

## How did I solve this?
I had multiple ways to achieve this in mind. One way is to use the position of the hand and set some kind of target position before a gesture counts
