# How can one directional motion be registered with hand tracking in VR?
For this deep dive I want to try to make a system which can detect not only static gestures, but also dyanmic gestures. As a first prototype I want to be able to detect a forward pushing motion.

## How did I solve this?
I had 2 ideas on how I could make dynamic gesture recognition, the first was to use a package that is used to recognize drawn shapes, this solution would not be helpful in this case. The second was to set a point the players hand has to move toward, but I did see some issues with this. I tried to ask Chat GPT if it had a better idea or a way for me to solve this problem. It came up with the idea to also include velocity. If i could get the directional velocity of the player's hand my problem would be solved

I started working on a system where the player needs to measure their arm to set the end point and made checks for the hands current position, velocity and if the correct static gesture was held. I also implemented this into the Secrets of Ignacios spell casting system, so I could test what it would be like if this system was implemented in the game I'm working on.

## What is the result?
I have created a system that accounts for velocity, distance and a static gesture, but I was not able to get the directional velocity from the player's hand. This caused problems in the system. The biggest issue was that if the player measured their arm to be shorter than it actually is, they could hold their hand in front of the point completing 2 out of 3 requirements. If they pull their hand backwards and stop it before getting behind the measured point, the spell would still fire. This behaviour is unintended. 

## What is the quality of the result
The result has bugs which I was not able to solve, it was also quite finicky in its use and if implemented into Secrets of Ignacios, it would worsen the players experience, since aiming would become very difficult again.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?
This solution would take too much time to create from scratch, I was not able to find anything that has this functionality either (game or unity package). Because of this I will try out my other idea and leave this one as is.
