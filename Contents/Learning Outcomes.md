# Learning Outcomes
Here the learning outcomes for this semester can be found, as well as what documents contribute to my progress toward these outcomes.


## Learning outcome 1: Analysis

You are able to obtain desired results by researching XR related subjects methodically and thorough.

With desired results we mean that you can clearly define the relevant research question at hand to scope the problem at hand to a manageable scale. This includes being able to define a design challenge where you take the client, trends, context and audience into account. Methodically means you show that you use justified research methods such as the DOT research framework. Thorough means that you use different methods of analysis and validate your insights.

## Learning outcome 2: Advise

You are able to make recommendations about important decisions in the design process for XR solutions based on the conclusions and results from the analysis and clearly communicate these recommendations to relevant stakeholders.

With recommendations we mean suggestions that you make that will help achieve desired outcomes. With clearly communicate we mean that you communicate with the relevant stakeholders in an appropriate way. This includes written reporting and pitch presentations.

## Learning outcome 3: Design

You show that you can design an XR solution in an analytical way using existing tools and theories. You are able validate XR related solutions for both functional and user interaction requirements using industry standard methods and deliverables.

Analytical means that you work is based on prior analysis insights. You support your design choices with sources such as: Target User Research, Existing products analysis, available technology research, stakeholder analysis, etc. With using existing tools and theories we mean examples such as: Design Patterns, Architectural Design, Design Thinking, MDA framework and Self Determination Theory as well as concept development methods such as diverging/converging, brainstorms, etc. You validate your designed XR solution in an early stage using efficient and quick prototyping methods such as paper prototyping, roleplaying and ‘Wizard of Oz’ and use the results to refine your design. Common deliverables are for example: Game Design document, Tech design document consisting of elements such as UML diagrams and software architecture diagram and prototypes such as paper prototypes, mockups and user tests.

## Learning outcome 4: Realisation

You show that you can create and validate a prototype in the form of a proof of concept, based on a design in a context where you create or adapt audiovisual and narrative assets using innovative and relevant techniques, and suitable user interaction in a complex context.

With create we mean that you are able to develop prototypes based on prior work and/or from scratch. You are able to validate these prototypes to verify the quality of the product using user tests and heuristics. With based on a design we mean that the prototypes are based on priosr designs. You use innovative and relevant techniques that suit your needs such as XR headsets, XR input and output device, Mobile devices, Controllers, Industry Standard Game Engines etc. With create or adapt we mean that you can create basic assets, but more realistically will find existing assets and alter them to suit your aesthetic and technical needs. The goal is that you seek out a balance in creating assets from scratch and using (adapted) existing work. With audiovisual and narrative assets, we mean all ‘art’ assets such as: 2d art, 3d art, synthesized and/or recorded sound effects, (dynamic) music, story, scripts (dialogue) etc. With suitable user interaction we mean that you design user interaction that supports a good user experience. A complex context means that the scope and complexity of both the situation and the product are representative of a real-world industry setting.

## Learning outcome 5: Manage & Control

You are able to work in a structured and methodical way both individually as well as in a group context where you use relevant processes and tooling to facilitate your process in order to achieve a desired level of quality.

With both individually as well as in a group context we mean that you show you can adjust the process accordingly. With relevant processes and tooling we mean processes and tools that are industry standard in order to effectively communicate and cooperate such as Scrum, version management and build management tools. With quality we mean that you are able to define a level of quality to adhere to in accordance with stakeholders. Non-functional requirements such as stability, performance, security, etc. could be used to define these criteria.

## Learning outcome 6: Professional Standard

Both individually and in teams, you apply a relevant methodological approach used in the professional field to formulate project goals, involve stakeholders, conduct applied research, provide advice, make decisions, and deliver reports. In doing so, you keep in view the relevant ethical, intercultural, and sustainable aspects.

In the XR Design minor, you adeptly apply methodological research approaches like the DOT framework to analyze user needs and stakeholder expectations effectively. Your strong communication skills allow you to inform and advise stakeholders across intercultural contexts, adhering to ethical standards. You proactively define project information needs, design targeted methodologies, and ensure your work is transparent, reproducible, and ethically sound. This approach guarantees that your contributions are impactful and professional.
