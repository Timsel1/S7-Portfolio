# What package is best for hand gesture recognition?
There are many hand tracking packages for unity, which include gesture recognition, but which one fits best with what I’m looking for during this 1 week project?

## Requirements
I have a couple requirements I want this package to:  
- 3d hand poses
- can recognise at least static poses (but dynamic would preferable)
- easy to set up with unity
- requires no other devices than the vr headset
- it is possible to create custom hand gestures
- has support for unity 6

## Different packages
I looked at different packages which work with unity for hand tracking, some of these are:  
- Open XR (XR Hands)
- Meta XR Interaction SDK
- HPTK (Hand Physics Toolkit)

### Open XR (XR Hands)
The XR Hands package is a Unity package available directly in the Package Manager, designed specifically for hand tracking within OpenXR applications. It is well integrated into Unity. It supports static 3D hand gesture recognition. Developers can create custom hand gestures using hand shape and hand pose assets, which are included with the package. The gesture recognition script included in the package contains unity events for when the gesture is performed and when it has ended, this makes it easy to trigger events per gesture.

This package is compatible with Meta Quest headsets, meaning no additional cameras or external devices are required to track hands or recognize gestures, as long as the headset itself also has this functionality. The tracking provided by Quest's onboard sensors is sufficient for hand recognition.

Additionally, the XR Hands package is fully documented in Unity’s manual, providing step-by-step guidance on setup, customization, and advanced usage, making it accessible even for developers new to hand tracking.

### Meta XR Interaction SDK
To use the Meta XR Interaction SDK, you are required to install 2 packages, the Meta XR Interaction SDK and the Meta XR Interaction SDK Essentials, for it to work. These packages can be found on the unity asset store instead of in the package manager in unity.

The Meta XR Interaction SDK is a Unity package designed to simplify hand tracking and gesture recognition for Meta Quest headsets specifically. Just like XR Hands it provides both predefined gestures and support for custom gesture detection. The SDK integrates into Unity’s XR environment. It also offers event-based hand interaction systems, making it easy to trigger actions based on specific gestures.

### HPTK
The HPTK (Hand Physics Toolkit) is a Unity package designed for advanced hand tracking, physics-based interactions, and accurate hand pose detection. It has no gesture detection functionality by itself, but the MRTK can be integrated which does have this feature. It is highly customizable and is tested with VR, AR and non XR applications. HPTK focuses on providing realistic hand-object interactions and enables precise control over hand poses, allowing developers to create gestures and interactions that feel natural in VR environments.

## Conclusion
From these choices it is obvious HPTK will not be picked, since it has no gesture recognition feature, but it is a good choice for people looking to create realistic hand interactions in their game.

Between the XR Hands and Meta XR Interaction SDK, which one is the better choice? This is dependent on your project, since they have almost all the same functionalities, I would say the main difference is, Meta’s SDK seems to have more depth when it comes to their script functionality and XR Hands seems to be easier when it comes to creating custom gestures.
So if you need to create a lot of scripts using Meta’s custom functions, you should choose the Meta SDK, but if you want to quickly create hand gestures and add functionality to the poses (like me) go with the XR Hands package.
