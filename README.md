# S7-Portfolio Tim Meijvogel
This is my portfolio for my 7th semester (the minor XR-Design).

This semester is made up of multiple projects, these projects are:

### Weeks 1-2: Exploring XR Devices and Creating a One-Week Project
The semester begins with an introduction to various XR devices. During Week 1, I will collaborate with small groups to experiment with a different XR device each day, learning the strengths and unique features of each. In Week 2, I will create a one-week project with a small group, in an XR direction of my choice, using the device that interests me most. 

### Weeks 3-10: Group Industry Project 1
Next, I will work in a group with five other students to develop an industry project over the course of eight weeks. Together, we have formed a game studio and will be working on designing and building a VR game. This project will involve understanding the needs of the target audience, planning and managing a game development pipeline, and producing an engaging XR experience. 

### Weeks 11-12: Individual Deep Dive Project
After the group industry project, I will have two weeks for an individual deep dive project. During this time, I will focus on an aspect of XR that interests me. This project will allow me to further explore my interests and expand my expertise in a chosen area of XR.

### Weeks 13-20: Group Industry Project 2
In the final eight weeks, I will either continue the first group project or start a second industry project with a new direction and challenge. This phase will be an opportunity to further develop Secrets of Ignacios or collaborate on an entirely new concept.

|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Sprint 0|Quick pace of working, we were ahead of schedule.|Getting in contact with the stakeholder.||
|Sprint 1:|We were able to set up important systems and create some visuals for the game already.|Some git use and code convention. Also how the group had contact with the stakeholder at the start of the sprint.|When not sure, ask me or look at code convention/manifesto. Set up group chat with the stakeholder. (already done)|
